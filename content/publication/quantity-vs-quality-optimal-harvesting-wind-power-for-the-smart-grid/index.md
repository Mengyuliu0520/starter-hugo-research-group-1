abstract: "The need to reduce greenhouse gases from our current power systems
  accelerates the integration of renewable energy sources (for example, wind and
  solar power). A fundamental difficulty is that renewable energy is usually of
  high variability. Numerous advancements in technologies and methods for the
  smart grid are required to mitigate and absorb this variability. In this
  paper, we focus on one of them: how to plan wind farms with high capacity and
  low variability locally and distributedly. First, we study the characteristics
  of both wind resource and wind turbines and propose a novel wind power
  estimation method based on Gaussian regression. The experimental result shows
  that our method achieves a more accurate estimation compared to other ones and
  has a nearly zero error for most of the turbine types. Then, we analyze a
  tradeoff between wind power's quantity and quality for large-scale wind farms,
  and find that there is an optimal turbine type for each location as to either
  the quantity or the quality. We propose an approach to optimally combine
  different types of wind turbines to balance the tradeoff. Finally, we explore
  geographical diversity among different locations and develop an extended
  approach that jointly optimizes the combination of locations and turbine
  types. Besides applying to plan new wind farms, we also discuss how to adapt
  the two approaches to decide an upgrade plan for a wind farm and a network of
  wind farms, respectively. We conduct extensive experiments using two different
  wind resource data traces for both local and distributed cases. The result
  shows that the proposed approaches significantly outperform those approaches
  using a single turbine type and those separately optimizing locations and
  turbine types. We also provide interesting insights about the quantity-quality
  balancing."
